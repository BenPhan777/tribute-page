                    <h2>Coat of Many Colors</h2>
                    <p>Parton was born on January 19, 1946, in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. Parton grew up poor in rural Appalachia. She was one of 12 children, and money was always an issue for her family. Her first exposure to music came from family members, including her mother, who sang and played guitar. At an early age, she also learned about music while performing in church.</p>

                    <h2>9 to 5</h2>
                    <p>Parton's singing career really started to take off in 1967. Around this time, she partnered with Porter Wagoner on The Porter Wagoner Show. Parton and Wagoner became a popular duo and the pair recorded a slew of country hits together. After having had several charting singles, Parton scored her first No. 1 country hit in 1971 with "Joshua," a bluegrass-inspired track about two solitary figures who find love. More No. 1 hits followed in the mid-'70s, including "Jolene," a haunting single in which a woman begs another beautiful woman not to take her man, and "I Will Always Love You" — a tribute to Wagoner as the two parted ways professionally. Parton perhaps reached the apex of her mainstream success in the 1980s. She not only starred with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin in the 1980 hit comedy 9 to 5, which marked her film debut but also contributed to its soundtrack. The title song, with one of the most memorable opening lines in popular music history, proved to be another No. 1 hit for Parton on both the pop and country charts and earned her an Academy Award nomination.</p>

                    <h2>Peace Train</h2>
                    <p>In 2019, Dolly Parton became the first country artist ever to be named the MusiCares Person of the Year. The honor came in recognition of the country icon's years of charity work and giving back. Parton's charity efforts are legendary, not just in her home state of Tennessee -- where she's worked for years to improve literacy and promote education via programs such as her <a href="https://imaginationlibrary.com/" target="_blank">Imagination Library</a> -- but worldwide. Over the years, she has supported the United Way and the Save the Music Foundation; donated items to charity; and participated in the Make-a-Wish program. Additionally, Parton has also dedicated money, time and support toward animal rights and HIV/AIDS charities. "I am impressed that Dolly doesn’t do anything that doesn’t grow to have a widespread impact," Parton's longtime friend and musical foil Kenny Rogers told <a href="https://parade.com/440799/beverlykeel/give-like-dolly-does/" target="_blank">Parade</a> in 2015.</p>
